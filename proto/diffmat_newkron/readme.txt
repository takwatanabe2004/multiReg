- Tested to see if the "KronProd" packge from http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25969-efficient-object-oriented-kronecker-product-manipulation/content/@KronProd/KronProd.m
  can help improve efficiency....but the object orientedness here is way too
  heavy-handed for practice (no addition, matrix concatenation, etc...)
- Thus, DITCHED
